    "### What is CellRank 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "**CellRank 2** is a framework for studying **cellular fate decisions** from single-cell data. It models cell-state transitions as a **Markov chain** on a cell-cell graph and identifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial states** (cells at the beginning of a process)\n",
    "- **Terminal states / macrostates** (fate endpoints)\n",
    "- **Fate probabilities** (likelihood each cell reaches each terminal state)\n",
    "- **Driver genes** correlated with specific fate decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key innovation of CellRank 2 over CellRank 1\n",
    "\n",
    "CellRank 1 relied exclusively on **RNA velocity** to provide directionality. CellRank 2 introduces a **modular kernel framework** that can incorporate diverse sources of directional information:\n",

    "## Part 0: Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Markov Chain Model\n",
    "\n",
    "CellRank models cell-state dynamics as a **Markov chain** on a KNN graph of cells. Each cell is a node, and directed, weighted edges represent transition probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **transition matrix** $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is row-stochastic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{ij} = P(X_{t+1} = j \\mid X_t = i), \\quad \\sum_j T_{ij} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Kernels Build the Transition Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Velocity Kernel\n",
    "For each cell $i$ with velocity vector $v_i$, the transition probability to neighbor $j$ is based on the **cosine similarity** between $v_i$ and the displacement vector $(x_j - x_i)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{T}_{ij} \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\cos(v_i, x_j - x_i)}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ controls the softmax sharpness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudotime Kernel\n",
    "Uses a **pseudotime** $\\tau_i$ assigned to each cell. The kernel biases transitions toward increasing pseudotime:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{T}_{ij} \\propto \\begin{cases} \\text{high} & \\text{if } \\tau_j > \\tau_i \\\\ \\text{low} & \\text{if } \\tau_j < \\tau_i \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it computes a soft threshold based on the pseudotime difference between neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RealTimeKernel (Optimal Transport)\n",
    "Given cells at discrete time points $t_1, t_2, \\ldots$, **optimal transport** (via the `moscot` package) computes a coupling matrix $\\pi$ that maps cells at $t_k$ to cells at $t_{k+1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi^* = \\arg\\min_\\pi \\sum_{i,j} c(x_i, x_j) \\pi_{ij} + \\varepsilon H(\\pi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c(x_i, x_j)$ is a cost (e.g., squared Euclidean distance in gene expression space), and $H(\\pi)$ is the entropic regularization term. The coupling $\\pi$ is then converted to a transition matrix on the full KNN graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CytoTRACE Kernel\n",
    "Uses **CytoTRACE** scores as a proxy for developmental potential (based on the number of expressed genes). This kernel biases transitions from high-potency to low-potency cells, acting like a pseudotime kernel but without needing a pre-computed pseudotime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel Combination\n",
    "Multiple kernels can be combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{\\text{combined}} = \\alpha \\cdot T_{\\text{kernel}_1} + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot T_{\\text{kernel}_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPCCA for Macrostate Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "CellRank 2 uses **Generalized Perron Cluster Cluster Analysis (GPCCA)** on the transition matrix to identify **macrostates** \u2014 groups of cells that are metastable (cells within a macrostate tend to stay there).\n",
    "\n",
    "This works by computing the **Schur decomposition** of $T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = Q R Q^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The leading Schur vectors reveal the coarse-grained structure. GPCCA then soft-assigns cells to macrostates. **Terminal states** are macrostates with high self-transition probability (absorbing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absorption Probabilities (Fate Probabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once terminal states are identified, CellRank computes **absorption probabilities**: for each non-terminal cell, the probability of eventually reaching each terminal state. This is solved from the linear system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{a}_m = (I - T_{\\text{transient}})^{-1} T_{\\text{transient} \\to m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{a}_m$ is the vector of absorption probabilities into terminal state $m$."
